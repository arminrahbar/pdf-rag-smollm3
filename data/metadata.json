Friedman8 Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a genetic neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration with substantial variability in severity and progression patterns. FSHD is a highly heterogeneous disease; however, current clinical metrics used for tracking disease progression lack sensitivity for personalized assessment, which greatly limits the design and execution of clinical trials. This study introduces a multi-scale machine learning framework leveraging whole- body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical data to predict regional, muscle, joint, and functional progression in FSHD.

Using a combined dataset of over 100 patients from seven studies, MRI-derived metrics—including fat fraction, lean muscle volume, and fat spatial heterogeneity at baseline—were integrated with clinical and functional measures. A three-stage random forest model was developed to predict annualized changes in muscle composition and a functional outcome (timed up-and-go (TUG)). All model stages revealed strong predictive performance in separate holdout datasets. After training, the models predicted fat fraction change with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.16% and lean volume change with a RMSE of 8.1 ml in a holdout testing dataset. Feature analysis revealed that metrics of fat heterogeneity within muscle predicts muscle- level progression. The stage 3 model, which combined functional muscle groups, predicted change in TUG with a RMSE of 0.6 s in the holdout testing dataset.

Further studies incorporating larger longitudinal cohorts, as well as comprehensive clinical and functional measures, will allow for expanding and refining this model. As many neuromuscular diseases are characterized by variability and heterogeneity similar to FSHD, such approaches have broad applicability. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a genetic neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, affecting approximately 1 in 7,500 individuals1. The genetic basis for FSHD—mutations leading to aberrant expression of the protein DUX4, which is toxic to muscles—is well established. Disease progression typically occurs over years in adult-onset FSHD and can affect skeletal muscles across the entire body2–10.

While these measures can provide valuable insights into function over longer periods, they have significant limitations in shorter-term settings, such as clinical trials lasting for shorter periods of time, such as a year or less.

The reasons for this placebo effect remain unclear but could involve motor learning effects or placebo responses. Similar limitations extend to other functional metrics, such as TUG and the 6-minute walk test, which may not capture progression uniformly across all patients. To address the limitations of global clinical metrics, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as the gold standard for quantifying muscle-level involvement in FSHD. MRI enables a detailed assessment of muscle composition, particularly the amount of fat infiltration, which serves as a reliable metric of disease expression. Despite the relative ease of acquiring whole-body imaging data, current analytic methods for segmenting and quantifying features at the individual muscle level remain limited.

Key revisions include: (1) while FSHD was historically thought to primarily affect specific muscles (e.g., scapular fixation muscles, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius), it is now evident that all muscles can be affected across the lifespan; (2) the pattern of muscle involvement and progression is highly variable across patients and muscle groups; and (3) within individual muscles, disease progression is heterogeneous, with varying degrees of fat infiltration and diverse patterns of structural degradation.

While this streamlined strategy aligns with the single-biomarker approach used in DMD27 it has several notable limitations: (1) it omits muscles above and below the specified threshold that may also be changing; (2) it disregards baseline muscle status and identity, which are known to influence change rates; (3) it overlooks fat distribution patterns, with confluence of fat being a characteristic feature of the disease; and (4) it averages data from muscles with distinct trajectories, effectively diluting the signal from muscles undergoing meaningful change by combining them with muscles showing little or no change.

Muscle distribution metrics Since disease progression is often heterogeneous within each muscle in FSHD, the Stage 1 model focused on slice- level, regionally sensitive level metrics. First, we computed muscle and fat quantities within the cross-section of each muscle in each axial slice and represented those metrics as a function of superior-inferior position along the muscle (as described previously24). Slice-level measurements are particularly sensitive to localized changes in fat distribution, which often occur within discrete anatomical zones. To summarize regional variation along the length of each muscle, we divided the muscle into eight longitudinal intervals along the superior-inferior direction spanning 10% increments — specifically: 10–20%, 20–30%, 30–40%, 40–50%, 50–60%, 60–70%, 70– 80%, and 80–90%.

Fig. 1. Schematic of the multi-scale disease progression modeling framework. Flow diagram illustrating the three-stage modeling framework used to predict muscle-level and functional progression in FSHD. The pipeline begins with MRI-based segmentation and analysis of muscle and bone from whole-body mDixon MRI scans at baseline. Stage 1 predicts regional fat fraction changes using sub-region data (eight regions per muscle). Stage 2 aggregates regional predictions to muscle-level, combining them with patient data to predict changes in muscle fat fraction (FF) and lean muscle volume (LMV). Stage 3 integrates muscle-level predictions with baseline timed up-and-go (TUG) measurements to predict changes in functional performance at follow- up. This framework captures the progression of disease from local muscle regions to functional-level outcomes.

This model was trained on 70% of the full data set, which included 4513 muscles, and the model was tested on 833 muscles. Cases with incomplete inputs for key variables were excluded from model training and testing, and no imputation was performed, ensuring that only complete data were used to maintain prediction reliability. For data points where fat fraction decreased or lean muscle volume increased over time, these changes were set to zero.

This framework enables the prediction of which muscles, and to what extent, will undergo changes over time during the natural course of the disease, offering a more precise and individualized approach to monitoring FSHD progression in clinical trials. Furthermore, the feature importance analyses provide insight into which factors best predict disease progression.

For example, the muscles that best predict TUG – the trunk extensors, hip extensors, and knee extensors – only changed in a subset of patients; therefore, TUG only changed in a subset of patients as well. Not surprisingly, the TUG at the baseline timepoint demonstrated a strong relationship with predicted change in TUG, as well. Taken together, these results suggest that the disease progression model provides a new approach for clinical trials that allows for patient-specific selection of functional metrics that are most likely to detect deviations from each individual’s disease progression and/or selection of qualified patients if specific functional metrics are of interest.

At the whole muscle (Stage 2 model) level, the predicted fat fraction change from the Stage 1 model, the muscle, the D4Z4 repeat length, the associated muscle group, femur size, femur fat fraction, and metric of overall involvement influenced change in fat fraction prediction. The explanations for some of these predictive features are intuitive and consistent with current knowledge, while others are novel and require further investigation.

Similarly, Fatehi et al. conducted a long-term follow-up of thigh muscles in FSHD patients, finding that quantitative MRI effectively monitored progressive fatty infiltration over time5.

First, while the model was developed based on what is likely the most complete dataset of muscle-level MRI in FSHD patients to date, more data would improve the robustness and predictive abilities of the model. Second, several parameters not included in this study would likely improve model performance. Additional measures like methylation, further clinical assessments, and blood biomarkers represent promising possible additions to the progression model. Third, we had limited access to functional measurements at the second time point; therefore, the Stage 3 model analysis was somewhat limited and only focused on one functional measurement (TUG) and a smaller subset of subjects and muscle groups based on available longitudinal task data. Despite these factors, the model lends itself to rapid future extension, with incorporation of more functional measurements spanning the lower and upper bodies.

Lastly, the model was trained based only on adult FSHD patient data; therefore, its robustness for predicting disease progression in pediatric patients with FSHD has not been evaluated. A new training dataset, that incorporates the effects of growth assessed by a similar metric of femur volume, would provide the opportunity for expanding the applicability of the model to pediatric populations. Additionally, the model was designed to focus on progression (i.e., fat fraction increase and lean muscle volume decrease), with data points showing improvement (fat fraction decrease or lean muscle volume increase) set to zero. Consequently, predictions of no change may reflect either stabilization or actual improvement, representing a limitation in the model’s ability to capture recovery processes.

This work represents a significant advancement in the use of machine learning and imaging to address the challenges of disease heterogeneity in FSHD. By integrating advanced MRI-derived muscle metrics with clinical and biological data, the proposed multi-scale framework reveals that individual muscle progression over a year interval is predictable, given a comprehensive integration of personalized data at baseline. The digital twin model serves as a powerful benchmark for assessing untreated progression, enhancing the precision and efficiency of tracking natural history changes over time. This advancement has broad potential applications in clinical trial design, including the use of personalized digital twins as surrogate placebos and leveraging the progression model’s identified features to better isolate ‘at-risk’ muscles in traditional trial designs. While incorporating additional biomarkers and expanding datasets will further refine predictive capabilities, this study lays the foundation for applying personalized machine learning and imaging approaches to "

Currently,dystrophinisconsideredoneofthemostimportantgenesinvolvedinDMD.Thisproteinis acomponentofthedystrophin-associatedproteincomplex(DAPC)[1,2]. Mutationsinthedystrophin gene on the X chromosome cause DMD; they damage the DAPC, causing creatine kinase to pass through muscle cell membranes into the blood, in turn, leading to elevated serum creatine kinase levels[2]. About5–15%ofDMDcasesarecausedbynonsensemutations,resultinginprematuretermination codons(PTCs)intheplaceofasensecodon. Thisleadstotheproductionofatruncateddystrophin protein [2,3]. Consequently, several therapeutic approaches for treating DMD have focused on suppressingPTCs. Onetherapeuticapproachinparticular—theuseofPTC-suppressingcompounds (PTCSCs)—relies on the fact that translation termination is not 100% efficient [3]. It depends on Molecules2020,25,3886;doi:10.3390/molecules25173886 www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules [Page 2] Molecules2020,"

Binding of near-cognateaminoacyl-tRNAstothestopcodoncausesanaminoacidtobeincorporated,resulting in the continuous production of protein, as there is no longer a stop codon to be recognized [3]. Thus, PTCSCs suppress PTCs by inducing translational readthrough, a mechanism that leads to theproductionoffull-lengthproteinbystimulatingthebindingofnear-cognatetRNAs,tothestop codon[3]. PTCSCsarehypothesizedtobindtothe30Sribosomalsubunitandinteractwiththe16SrRNA andS12ribosomalprotein[4].

OneclassofPTCSCsisaminoglycosideantibiotics. Aminoglycosides,suchasgentamicinand paromomycin, have been found to stimulate readthrough and suppress PTCs. However, the use of these drugs is limited, as they may induce ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, manifesting in side effects such as hearing loss and diminished renal function [5]. Their efficacy is also influenced by otherfactors,suchasstopcodoncontextandsequencespecificity. Previousstudieshavefoundthat readthrough levels induced by aminoglycosides have the order UGA > UAG >> UAA, and a +4 cytosineimmediatelyfollowingthePTCproducedthemostreadthrough,duetothepreventionof eRF1recognitionofthePTC[5].

Ataluren has been proposed to stimulate readthrough by binding to the h44 decoding center of the 16S rRNA in the 30S ribosomal subunit [9]. While this drug has been found to have significantly lower toxicity, conflicting results have been found in regard to its efficacy [10,11]. AnotherPTC-suppressingcompound,negamycin,exhibitedlowertoxicitythanaminoglycosides[11]. Negamycin follows a similar mechanism of action to aminoglycosides, binding to the ribosomal A site. [11].

This was due to a greater number of pharmacophore features elucidated in the Cluster B pharmacophore model than in the Cluster A pharmacophore model (ten, rather than seven), which increased the selectivity of the pharmacophore search.

The partial matches, which included compounds with correspondence to at least eight of the 10 features for the NCI database search and nine of the 10 features for the DrugBank database search, allowed us to increase the number of hits generated. 2.4.1. NCI Database Search We searched an NCI compounds database containing 260,071 experimental compounds using the two pharmacophore models. When we searched the NCI compounds database with the five-of- five feature pharmacophore for Cluster A, 35 compounds were elucidated with 234 conformations. These 35 compounds contain all five pharmacophore features. When we searched the database with the eight-of-ten feature pharmacophore for Cluster B, 100 compounds were elucidated containing eight of the ten pharmacophore features, at minimum. Of the 135 total compounds found by the NCI database search, twelve top-scoring compounds were selected with greatest correspondence to the Molecules2020,25,3886 pharmacophore centers (Table 1). 6of26 Table 1.

Selecting which of these models to apply and how to apply them when searching a large molecular database is not straightforward. We describe two approaches, one either selects the single model they feel suits their problem or situation best, or uses multiple models in a committee approach, one in which multiple models are used as voters in a final decision. A single model should be selected if it greatly exceeds the performance of the other models developed in most or all the metrics being tracked. A committee approach often works very well if the models do not seem to obviously separate those themselves from each other, yet all perform well enough. We considered first the false negative rates on the test sets, and second the false positive rates on the test sets to determine which approach might be best in this situation.

We elucidated the QSAR descriptors most useful to our modeling problem to analyze their relation to inhibitory activity on the 30S ribosome. Molecular refractivity (including implicit hydrogens)—SMR—proved to be most suitable for this comparison, displaying the strongest linear relationship to IC50 for these compounds (Figure 5) [36].
